# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

## 1. Introduction 

This document defines the complete Software Requirements Specification for the **GR to UD Automation System**. It includes client requirements, functional and non-functional requirements, workflow descriptions, and system constraints.

A dedicated section — **Section 2: Client‑Provided Requirements** — is included to capture every requirement directly stated by the client.

---

## 2. Client-Provided Requirements

This section records all requirements received directly from the client through meetings, discussions, or messages.

### **2.1 Functional Requirements from Client**

1. **GR Member Page with VCRR Data Fetching & QR Code Generation**

   * A page must be created where a **GR member logs in**.
   * The system must **fetch data automatically from the VCRR**.
   * The GR member must be able to **add additional fields** such as:

     * GR Number
     * GR Date
     * Additional remarks or reference info
   * The system must **generate two QR codes**:

     * A detailed QR storing all GR + VCRR + item details
     * A reference QR for quick identification

2. **Inspection Page with Two Sections**
   A new inspection page must be created containing:

   * **Material Inspection Section**
   * **Sub‑Contract Inspection Section**
     The GR details generated by the GR member must be automatically **routed to the correct section based on part number series**.

3. **Indenter Login for Material Conformance**

   * A separate login must be created for the **Indenter**.
   * The Indenter must be able to **view all GR details** sent for inspection.
   * The Indenter can take the following actions:

     * **Accept** the GR
     * **Reject** the GR with a **remark/comment**
   * The system must store acceptance or rejection status and pass it to the next workflow stage.

### **2.2 Non-Functional Requirements from Client**

* System should be easy to use for factory staff.
* Fast loading screens (target < 3 seconds).
* Secure role-based login access.
* QR code should be scannable on mobile and industrial scanners.

### **2.3 Clarifications / Pending Inputs**

* Expected format of VCRR data API or file structure.
* Part number series logic for routing to inspection sections.

---

## 3. Stakeholders

* **Admin** – system configuration and user management.
* **GR Member** – enters GR details and generates QR codes.
* **Inspection Team** – validates and inspects materials.
* **Indenter** – accepts or rejects material conformance.

---

## 4. Overall Description

The system ensures digital transformation of the GR to UD process. It connects GR entry, inspection workflows, indenter approval, and final decision recording. QR code technology enhances traceability throughout the process.

---

## 5. System Workflow Summary

1. GR member logs in and fetches VCRR data.
2. GR member adds GR details and generates QR codes.
3. GR details are routed to Material or Sub‑Contract Inspection based on part number.
4. Inspection team verifies materials and updates inspection status.
5. GR details are forwarded to the Indenter for conformance.
6. Indenter accepts or rejects with remarks.
7. System records all actions and generates reports.

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

* VCRR data fetching and validation.
* GR detail entry form with required fields.
* QR generation (detailed + reference).
* Automatic routing of GR details.
* Inspection entry forms for two inspection categories.
* Indenter review, acceptance, and rejection.
* User authentication and role permissions.
* Dashboard for GR, inspection, and indenter statuses.

---

## 7. Non‑Functional Requirements

* Performance: Pages must load < 3 seconds.
* Security: Authentication & authorization required.
* Scalability: Should support multiple departments.
* Availability: 99% uptime target.
* Data integrity: No loss of GR or inspection data.

---

## 8. System Architecture

* **Frontend:** Web-based application for GR, inspection, and indenter modules.
* **Backend:** API service for business logic and data routing.
* **Database:** Stores GR, inspection, and user data.
* **Auth Layer:** Role-based access control.
* **QR Service:** Generates QR codes for GR items.

---

## 9. Data Model

**Entities:**

* Users
* GR Records
* VCRR Data
* Inspection Records
* Indenter Reviews
* Logs & History

---

## 10. UI/UX Requirements

* Simple and minimal interface for factory staff.
* Clear separation between GR, Inspection, and Indenter sections.
* QR preview and download option.
* Dashboards for task tracking.

---

## 11. Risks & Constraints

* VCRR data availability issues.
* Incorrect part number mapping logic.
