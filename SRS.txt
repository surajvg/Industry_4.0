Software Requirements Specification (SRS) Automation of GR to UD Process with Barcode/QR Code Integration


---

1. Introduction

1.1 Purpose of the Document

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document defines the functional, non-functional, technical, and operational requirements for the automation of the Goods Receipt (GR) to Usage Decision (UD) process in SAP using Barcode/QR code technology. The intended audience includes business stakeholders, SAP consultants, developers, QA teams, automation engineers, project managers, and system integrators.

1.2 Project Overview

The project aims to automate the GR to UD cycle by eliminating manual interventions such as PDF uploads, inspection data entry, and rejection tracking. The automation will leverage OCR, QR/Barcode generation, SAP BAPIs, and real-time dashboards to improve traceability, accuracy, and efficiency.

1.3 Document Scope

This SRS provides details on system workflows, user interactions, technical architecture, integrations, technology stack, constraints, assumptions, and acceptance criteria.

2. Purpose & Business Objective

The primary objectives are:

Reduce manual effort and human dependency in GR-UD processing.

Improve operational accuracy and reduce data entry-related errors.

Enable real-time tracking and full auditability of received materials.

Introduce item-level traceability using Barcode/QR code integration.

Accelerate approval, inspection, and decision posting in SAP.



---

3. Background / Problem Statement

The existing GR to UD process within SAP involves:

Manual PDF uploads

Paper-based verification

Manual GR and UD posting

Lengthy inspection cycles

Manual tracking of rejected materials


These lead to delays, errors, limited traceability, compliance gaps, and absence of automated reporting.


---

4. System Scope

The proposed automation will:

Automate PDF extraction using OCR

Validate extracted PO & material details against SAP

Generate unique QR/Barcodes for each material line

Automate GR posting using SAP BAPI

Capture inspection acceptance/rejection through QR scan

Auto-post UD decisions in SAP

Trigger notifications, emails, and audit logs

Provide dashboards for monitoring and reports



---

5. Stakeholders

Stakeholder	Responsibility

Supplier	Uploads invoice/delivery challan PDF
Indentor	Verifies received items
Store/Inspection Team	Scans QR and records accepted/rejected items
SAP System	Posts GR & UD transactions
Automation Tool	OCR, validation, QR, API integration & reporting
IT/Admin	System configuration, access control & monitoring



---

6. Existing Workflow (As-Is)

1. Supplier submits delivery challan or invoice PDF.


2. Indentor/Inspection team manually verifies received materials.


3. Store manually creates GR in SAP.


4. Inspection team records acceptance/rejection manually.


5. UD posting performed manually.


6. Rejected materials tracked outside SAP using spreadsheets.




---

7. Proposed Workflow (To-Be)

Step 1 — Document Upload & OCR Extraction

Supplier uploads PDF.

System extracts PO, batch, material description, and quantity.

Extracted values validated with SAP PO data.


Step 2 — Barcode/QR Code Generation

System generates unique QR per material line item.

QR includes PO, GR, batch, and quantity mapping.


Step 3 — Automated GR Creation

GR posted via BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE.

GR number stored and linked to QR.


Step 4 — Indentor Verification

Indentor scans QR for acknowledgment.

Rejected items logged with rejection reason.


Step 5 — Store/Inspection Processing

Inspection team scans QR, records accepted/rejected data.

SAP updated via BAPI_INSPOPER_RECORDRESULTS.


Step 6 — Automated UD Posting

System triggers BAPI_INSPLOT_SETUSAGEDECISION.


Step 7 — Reporting & Notifications

Auto-email/SMS notifications triggered.

Dashboard updated with item status.


Step 8 — Exception Handling

System logs failed OCR, SAP posting attempts, and QR validations.
