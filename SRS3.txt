# **1. Introduction**

## **1.1 Purpose of the Document**

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document outlines the business need, system functionality, architecture, constraints, technical requirements, and acceptance criteria for the automation of the Goods Receipt (GR) to Usage Decision (UD) process using OCR and QR/Barcode technology integrated with SAP. It serves as a reference for developers, SAP integrators, QA teams, business stakeholders, and implementation partners.

## **1.2 Intended Audience**

* Business Owners & Process Stakeholders
* SAP Functional & Technical Consultants
* Software Architects & Developers
* QA & Testing Teams
* Procurement & Store Teams
* Automation / RPA Teams

# **2. Business Purpose & Objectives**

The project aims to:

* Automate GR-to-UD workflow end-to-end
* Reduce manual workload and human dependency
* Improve accuracy in material receipt and inspection
* Enable real-time item traceability and auditability
* Standardize vendor documentation and inspection procedures
* Eliminate spreadsheet-based rejected material tracking

---

# **3. Problem Statement**

Currently, the GR to UD process involves:

* Manual PDF uploads into SAP
* Human-led extraction and verification of PO details
* Manual GR posting and UD entry
* No QR or item-level traceability
* Rejection reasons maintained offline
* High chances of data mismatch and compliance issues

As a result:

* Efficiency drops
* Processing time increases
* Error probability rises
* Audit and transparency gaps exist

---

# **4. System Scope**

The proposed system will:

* Accept and extract data from supplier delivery PDFs
* Validate extracted values using SAP PO data
* Generate QR codes for each material line
* Automate GR creation using SAP BAPI
* Enable scanning-based verification and inspection
* Automate UD decision posting
* Provide real-time dashboards and reports
* Log all activities for compliance and audits

### **Out of Scope (Current Phase)**

* Material return automation
* SAP MM configuration changes
* Vendor portal integration
* Mobile app development (planned future enhancement)

| --------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Supplier              | External   | Uploads invoice/delivery document                  |
| Indentor              | Business   | Confirms receipt of goods                          |

| SAP System            | ERP        | Posts GR & UD transactions                         |
| Automation Tool       | System     | OCR, validation, QR, API, logging & reporting      |
| QA Team               | Testing    | Performs system and integration testing            |
| IT/SAP Basis          | Support    | User access, RFC connectivity, system availability |

# **6. Existing Workflow (As-Is)**

1. Supplier submits invoice/delivery challan manually.
2. Team uploads PDF into SAP.
3. PO details manually verified and entered.
4. GR manually posted in SAP.
5. Physical items inspected and results recorded manually.
6. UD decision manually entered in SAP.
7. Rejected material tracked separately using Excel or registers.

Pain Points:

* Manual effort & delays
* Human errors
* No standardized rejection tracking
* Lack of real-time visibility

---

# **7. Proposed Workflow (To-Be)**

### **Step 1: Document Upload & OCR Extraction**

* Supplier uploads invoice PDF to web portal.
* System extracts PO number, item description, quantity, batch, and supplier name.
* Extracted data validated against SAP PO via API.

### **Step 2: QR/Barcode Generation**

* System generates unique QR per material line item.
* QR contains encrypted PO, GR, batch, material code, and quantity.
* System prints labels using Zebra printer.

### **Step 3: Automated GR Posting**

* GR auto-posted using `BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE`.
* SAP returns GR number and status.
* System stores mapping of PO → GR → QR.

### **Step 4: Indentor Verification**

* Indentor scans QR to confirm material receipt.
* Accepted & rejected items recorded digitally.

### **Step 5: Inspection & Quality Process**

* Inspection team scans QR during quality testing.
* Accepted/rejected quantity and remarks entered.
* SAP updated via `BAPI_INSPOPER_RECORDRESULTS`.

### **Step 6: Automated UD Posting**

* UD posted using `BAPI_INSPLOT_SETUSAGEDECISION`.
* SAP inspection lot updated.

### **Step 7: Reporting & Notifications**

* Auto-generated summary PDF reports
* Email/SMS notifications for approvals, delays, rejections
* Web dashboard displays live GR/UD metrics

### **Step 8: Exception Handling**

* Logs OCR extraction failures
* Logs mismatched SAP data
* Tracks incomplete UD postings
* Generates corrective action alerts
